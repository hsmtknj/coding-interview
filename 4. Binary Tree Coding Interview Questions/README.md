# Build Explanation

In this directory, we use "BinaryTree.cpp", "BinaryTree.hpp" which are self-made class.

So, if you execute programs in this directory, please build these programs including the avobe classes.

And you can also use "Makefile" to buile programs easily.

# How to use "Makefile"
- Move to this directory
- Put the following command in the case of "q1-1"
```
make q1-1
```
