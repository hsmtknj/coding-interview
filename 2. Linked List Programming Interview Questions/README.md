# Build Explanation

In this directory, we use "SinglyLinkedList.cpp", "SinglyLinkedList.hpp", "DoublyLinkedList.cpp", "DoublyLinkedList.hpp" which are self-made class.

So, if you execute programs in this directory, please build these programs including the avobe classes.

And you can also use "Makefile" to build programs easily.

# How to use "Makefile"
- Move to this directory
- Put the following command in the case of "q1-1"
```
make q1-1
```
